# sports-timer
I couldn't find a good online timer that I could use for Crossfit and tabata style workouts that looked good on iPad/iPhone, so I made one.

##Installing on iOS
The app is a webpage but I would suggest adding it to your home screen as an app.  You will then get the timer in full-screen mode each time it launches.

##Disclaimer
This app has been tested on iOS on both an iPhone and iPad and on Chrome/Mac.

##TODO:
