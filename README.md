# sports-timer
I couldn't find a good online sports timer for intervals and tabata that looks good on mobile/tablet, so I made one.

##Installing on iOS
The app is a webpage but I would suggest adding it to your home screen as an app.  You will then get the timer in full-screen mode each time it launches.

##Ad-Blockers
If you are not seeing the correct font when the page loads, make sure you disable your ad blocker for the app URL.

##Disclaimer
This app has been tested on iOS on both an iPhone and iPad and on Chrome/Mac.

##TODO:
 - Countdown when starting the timer
 - Tabata feature
